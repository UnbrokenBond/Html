    <h2>R. Christian Wilkerson</h2>
    <p>
        I go by Christian and I currently live in Ririe Idaho with my parents. They have some property where I regularly am taking care of chickens, a garden, and an occasional project. I am marrried to my wonderful wife Diana, and we are currently expecting our first child in the next few weeks, his name is Lorenzo.

    <p>
        Historically I love sports and being outdoors. I grew up playing competitive soccer, camping, and some occasional whitewater. More recently due to covid, moving in with my parents, and having a kid on the way, priorities have changed. I spend most days doing some form of work, either house or job. When I have time for myself now, I usually too tired to go out and be more active and I am now more of a movie junky, youtube learner, and play some video games.

    <p>
        Professionally I have already received a degree and spent a year in the health care field, and discovered it was not for me. Luckily I am in a position in life that I can go back to school and do something more in line with life goals and personality.

        I have been a member my whole life, but my mom and wife are both converts to the church. One of my favorite talks/speeches is by Bruce C. Hafen and was given at BYU provo. The talk is entitled, 
        <a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/bruce-c-hafen/love-is-not-blind-thoughts-college-students-faith-ambiguity/" target=_blank>
        "Love Is Not Blind: Some Thoughts for College Students on Faith and Ambiguity."

         He shares a story, it is kind of long, but here it is:
    </p>
    <p>  
        "One Sunday morning, the Elders Quorum in our ward held a special testimony meeting characterized by spiritual warmth and personal openness. During that meeting, a fellow law student related a boyhood experience that had occurred just after he had been ordained a deacon. He lived on a farm and had been promised that a calf about to be born would be his very own to raise. One summer morning when his parents were away, he was working in the barn when the expectant cow began to calve prematurely. He watched in great amazement as the little calf was born; and then, without warning, the mother suddenly rolled over the little calf. He could see that she was trying to kill it. In his heart he cried out to the Lord for help. Not thinking about how much more the cow weighed than he did, he pushed on her with all his strength and somehow moved her away. He picked up the lifeless body of the calf in his arms and, brokenhearted, the tears running down his cheeks, he looked at it, wondering what had happened and what he could do. Then he remembered, he told us, that he now held the Priesthood and had every right to pray for additional help. And so he prayed from the depths of his boyish, believing heart. Before long the little animal began breathing again, and he knew that his prayer had been heard.
    </p>
    <p>
        After relating the story, the tears welled up in his eyes and he said to us, “Brethren, I tell you that story because I don’t know that I would do now what I did then. I think I might not expect the Lord’s help in that kind of situation. I am not sure that I would believe now, even if I relived that experience, that the calf’s survival was anything more than a coincidence. I don’t understand what has happened to me since that incident, but I sense that something has gone a little bit wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
        I really relate with this story at times and it is a good reminder to keep working on my testimony and staying close with God. I strongly believe if you are not continuing to have spiritual experiences, the past will slowly become something of a coincidence.</p>
