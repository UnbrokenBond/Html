    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>Us:
        Hello we are the Browns! Family is super important to us; we have a loving toddler who drives us crazy sometimes. Every day is an adventure that we get to experience! Since our vows, we have promised to always be there for each other as husband and wife; encouraging each other to be our best selves. And this is a pledge we are making to our clients; we hope you can experience our passion for the art and for helping others. 
        </ul>
      <ul>Why Cosmetology:
        We have been experimenting with hair styles, hair coloring, and spa days all before even considering going to cosmetology school. Sara decided that she loved it and her excitement got me (Wyatt) excited to join her. We both fell in love with experiences of seeing friends and family smile and love what we have been able to do for them. As someone who has always struggled with self-perception, doing what we do now makes me so happy helping people be more confident in their look. We also love the adventure of helping others find “their” own look, it sometimes feels like we are genies making peoples dreams come true. 
        </ul>
      <ul>Our Vision:
        Our vision is founded on why we took this path in the first place and is how we came up with our slogan, “Dyeing for change.” Our primary goal is to help others make a positive change. We want to help you, love you! And be a part of our family. Secondly, if you cannot tell by now, we want everyone to be excited to for new beginnings and trying something new.

    <h3>Services</h3>
    <p>
     <ul>Balayage: Dye or lightener is usually painted on, starting midshaft and becoming denser as it moves down the section of hair to the ends.</ul> 
     <ul>Partial Highlight: The top layer of hair is dyed, while leaving the rest untouched. </ul> 
     <ul>Blowout: is the art of drying your hair after a wash into the desired style. With a blowout, you can create curly hair, straight hair or subtle waves without any curling or flat iron involved.</ul> 
     <ul>Formal Styling: As the name suggests, we can help prepare your hair and make-up for formal occasions like weddings, proms, homecomings, or that special occasion. </ul> 
     <ul>Olaplex Add On: Is a system that permanently rebuilds the damaged disulphide bonds in your hair that are broken during the chemical process. If you've over-bleached or had your hair highlighted for years, Olaplex allows you to rebuild the strength, structure and integrity of your hair.</ul> 
     <ul>Color Gloss:  Is a shine treatment for colored-strands. The intended outcome of using a hair gloss is a longer-lasting and more vibrant hair color, as well as reducing split ends, frizzy hair, and overall dryness.</ul>
