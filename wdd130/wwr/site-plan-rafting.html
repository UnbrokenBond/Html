    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Provide the best wrafting experience for young adults. What is the "best?" This encompases a social aspect that most young adults are looking for and potentially even businesses looking for a business retreat and team building.</p>
    
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Young adults are part of a huge untaped market in whitewater, especially those looking for a social experience. Cruises have already capitalized on this. Unlike most wrafting companies highlighting a typical wraft down the water, we will be providing a "find yourself journey" or "Social Bonding" all with individual and team-building challenges on and off the water.</p>
